==== Motivation to Participate

* Assess the feasibility of implementing OGC's new OpenAPI-based
Features API as native operations in the MAGE server to expose MAGE data
through a standard, interoperable API.
* Assess the feasibility of implementing a consumer of OGC's new OpenAPI-based Features API that can build GeoPackages using standard feature
data from multiple different services for offline use in MAGE and any other
offline-capable mobile app.

==== Experiences with OGC API Specifications

* The https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES[OGC API - Features repository] reuse of the https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa[Simple Features specification] was helpful.

==== Other Impressions & Recommendations
All of the following are based on reading http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/17-069r2.html.

* Keep the https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES[OGC API - Features] repository up to date, including
** the https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/cholmesgeo/WFS3/M1[SwaggerHub] referenced from the https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/blob/master/README.md#using-the-standard[README]
** the local https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/blob/master/openapi.yaml[yaml] documents
* Improve the documentation on CRS extension usage
* Validate the https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/blob/master/implementations.md[referenced implementations] against the current specification
* Update Simple Feature references to refer to https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa[Simple Feature Access - Part 1: Common Architecture], version 1.2.1, http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=25355[document 06-103r4]
* Consider requiring https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/introduction.html#html-vs-xhtml[_XML syntax for HTML_] for HTML conformance, which implies all HTML documents are well-formed.
** makes the document more machine-friendly without sacrificing
human-readability
** makes the document easier to consume for dynamic/generic clients using widely
available XML libraries instead of more lax, HTML-specific libraries with HTML's
specific parsing requirements
** facilitates HTTP/1.1 agent-driven negotiation for non-user-facing clients
whose initial request to a service returns an HTML response
** enables the use of XPath and XSLT on HTML documents
* section 5.5.3: core response requirements defined using OpenAPI JSON Schema
fragments imply a response media type of `application/json`.  Is this actually
the requirement?  Either way, this requires more specific explanation.
* section 7.2: Is the core requirement for the landing page to return JSON by
default?
* Section 7.2.2, landing page response: If following RFC 8288, the link relation
types `conformance` and `data` should be URIs, according to RFC 8288, section
2.1.2, because they are "extension" link types that do not appear in the
https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml[IANA Registry].
* section 7.3.2 requirement 4 specifies use of `Accept` header for content
negotiaion of the api documentation (service-desc, service-doc)
** again, one of either service-desc or service-doc should be sufficient. what
happens when requesting service-doc with Accept application/json, or
service-desc with Accept text/html?
* http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/17-069r2.html#_declaration_of_conformance_classes[section 7.4]: Ostensibly, the response for the `/conformance` path must be a
JSON document, but the language in the spec is not clear.  Is that the case?
If so, the requirements should state the required `Content-Type` of the response
is `application/json` and the JSON document must be valid with respect to the
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/schemas/conf-classes.yaml[OpenAPI JSON Schema].
* section 7.9: another reference to content negotiation as defined by HTTP/1.1.
HTTP/1.1 content negotiation is quite abstract without many concrete
requirements.  The _NOTE_ at the end of the section gives the `accept` and `f`
query parameters as examples.
* Require specific attributes on HTML links so a dynamic client can easily parse
and inspect them, and to enable automated testing of the HTML conformance class
rather than having to
http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/17-069r2.html#_html_content["Manually inspect the document against the schema."]
Some ideas for HTML `link` and `a` tags are below.
** Require the `rel` attribute to include the relationship types the spec defines.
** Require the `type` attribute to specify the media type of the target link.
** Perhaps require the `class` attribute to include a meaningful marker, such
as ogc:api.
** If other link attributes are necessary, the spec could define data tag
requirements.

===== Content Negotiation
During the hackathon, we had some issues developing the _OGC API - Features_
client against the available services relating to content negotiation. We
observed that many of the OGCAF service implementations used at the hackathon
relied on the `f=json` query parameter to return GeoJSON to the client, while
the value in the `Accept` request header had no effect.  This is presumably due
to the note block in https://www.kalea.at/en/news-en/out-now-german-bier-box-xxl/[section 7.9]
and some example http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/17-069r2.html#example_12[snippets]
in the OGCAF draft spec document using that parameter as a strategy for content
negotiation.  However, that parameter is not a formal requirement or
recommendation anywhere in the specification.

There are several points in the spec document that reference HTTP content
negotiation to determine the format of the response as described in the
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-12[HTTP/1.1 spec].  Requirement
http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/17-069r2.html#_http_1_1[req/core/http],
and http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/17-069r2.html#encodings[section 7.9]
states that `req/core/http` implies server implementations must support content
negotiation as the HTTP/1.1 spec defines.  Unfortunately, while the HTTP/1.1
spec describes the options of server-driven and agent-driven negotiation,
requirements for implementing both types of negotiation are open-ended, leaving
many details to individual implementations.

The OGCAF Core conformance class could simplify client development by defining
concrete requirements for content negotiation.  For example, all server
implementations must use a `format` query parameter whose value is a media type
string or media type short alias, such as `format=json`.  This would be the
implementation of server-driven negotiation.

For agent-driven negotiation, the OGCAF Core could include a requirement that
all resources with `alternate` links to other representations must include those
`alternate` links in the `Link` response header and must include the link `type`
attribute, per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288#section-3[RFC 8288].  This is
a formal http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/17-069r2.html#_link_headers[recommendation]
in the OGCAF spec at the time of this writing, but includes wording that
invalidates the recommendation under certain circumstances.  For the specific
purpose of `alternate` links of the context resource, the `Link` header should
be a requirement so generic clients can have concrete expectations to negotiate
the content types they support.  This would also allow clients to obtain the
`alternate` links with a `HEAD` request as opposed to a more expensive `GET`
request.
