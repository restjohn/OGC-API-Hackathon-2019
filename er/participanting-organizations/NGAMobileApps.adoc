==== Motivation to Participate

* Assess the feasibility of implementing OGC's new OpenAPI-based
Features API as native operations in the MAGE server to expose MAGE data
through a standard, interoperable API.
* Assess the feasibility of implementing a consumer of OGC's new OpenAPI-based Features API that can build GeoPackages using standard feature
data from multiple different services for offline use in MAGE and any other
offline-capable mobile app.

==== Implemented Solution

* https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-server/tree/wfs3[MAGE server OGC API - Features]
* https://github.com/ngageoint/ogc-api-features-json-java[OGC API Features JSON]
** Extends https://github.com/ngageoint/simple-features-geojson-java/tree/develop[Simple Features GeoJSON]
* GeoPackage Feature generator
** https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-core-java/tree/develop/src/main/java/mil/nga/geopackage/features[GeoPackage Core]
** https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-java/tree/develop/src/main/java/mil/nga/geopackage/features[GeoPackage Java]
** https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-android/tree/develop/geopackage-sdk/src/main/java/mil/nga/geopackage/features[GeoPackage Android]

==== Proposed Alternatives

* None

==== Experiences with OGC API Specifications

* The https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES[OGC API - Features repository] reuse of the https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa[Simple Features specification] was helpful.

==== Other Impressions & Recommendations

* Keep the https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES[OGC API - Features] repository up to date, including
** the https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/cholmesgeo/WFS3/M1[SwaggerHub] referenced from the https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/blob/master/README.md#using-the-standard[README]
** the local https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/blob/master/openapi.yaml[yaml] documents
* Improve the documentation on CRS extension usage
* Improve the documentation on usage of the Accept request HTTP header and how it relates to the f parameter in next response links
* Validate the https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/blob/master/implementations.md[referenced implementations] against the current specification
